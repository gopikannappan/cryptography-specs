# Proofs: every slot advance within the horizon succeeds on a bounded state

A run of slots advances a state one slot at a time, with the upgrades due on the way.

Each state that it reaches keeps the invariant, the shape of the state and the bounds of the run.

So every slot advance within the horizon succeeds, under three hypotheses on the states reached.

From Electra, a run of empty slots leaks.

Within about `7.7 * 10^5` epochs no validator stays at the cap of the draw.

The hypothesis on the draws asks only that each draw ends, which needs no validator at the cap.

On mainnet the bounds alone hold for `2.25 * 10^6` epochs, about 27 years.
